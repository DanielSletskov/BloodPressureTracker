I first created a folder for storing the solution. 

I then created an angular project which is saved in the BloodPressureTrackerApp folder which is my main solutino for the assignment. 

I also created a api using expressjs and nodemon this is saved in the api folder.

I created a folder named  QUERIES in BloodPressureTrackerApp were I saved the initial SQL query for the database.
Since the focus of this assignment isnt database development the query is pretty simple.


RUNNING APPLICATION GUIDE :
OPEN TWO TERMINALS IN IDE(I used Visual studio code)
Locate one at the API folder and the other at the BloodPressureTrackerApp folder.
Then in the API terminal run this command nodemon api.js

followed by the command ng serve this in the BloodPressureTrackerApp terminal.
